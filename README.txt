Pacman Portal recreates Pac-Man with the addition of portals.
Use Q to create a blue portal, E for orange, and use SPACEBAR to clear them
Only 2 player portals can be active at a time, so the player must pay attention
in order to clear as necessary.
Ghosts can only enter portals after level 10, they ignore them before that
point.
Chomp on 4 ghosts to enable the fruit bonus, only once per level.
